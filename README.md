For connecting to the database and get the data to use in the android application, we used PHP language with MYSQL database to get the data from the database and change in the database and send requests.
To view the 360 degrees photos and videos, we used third-party tools and APIs to download and render photos and videos, and use the sensors and the touch screen to view the media and have an excited experience while using it.
